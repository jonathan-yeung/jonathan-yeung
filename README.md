## My Projects
### [The "Adventure" Playlist](https://www.github.com/jonathan-yeung/adventure_playlist)
I created a recommender system to find "relevant but novel" music tracks for listeners, and added a slide bar for them to customize the playlist for themselves.
Used techniques:
- content-based recommendation
- clustering: K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Agglomerative, GMM
- NLP: Count-vectorization

### [Quant/Algo Trading on Bitcoin - Analysis and Backtesting](https://www.github.com/jonathan-yeung/trading_strategies)
In this project, I found insights about the Bitcoin market and backtested strategies to see whether they are effective.
Some main types of strategies were tested:
- Mean Reversion
- Trend Following

I also carried out a time series analysis on BTC-USD using the Box-Jenkins Method, fit an ARIMA model to the data, and made point forecasts and interval forecasts using the selected ARIMA model.

Used techniques:
- visualizations: Plotly, matplotlib, seaborn
- data manipulations: NumPy, Pandas
- backtesting: Object-Oriented Programming
- statistical testing: stastmodels, SciPy, sklearn
- time series analysis (ARIMA), time series forecasting
