### Hi there 👋

## My Projects
### The "Adventure" Playlist
I created a recommender system to find "relevant but novel" music tracks for listeners, and added a slide bar for them to customize the playlist for themselves.
Used techniques:
- content-based recommendation
- clustering: K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Agglomerative, GMM
- NLP: Count-vectorization
