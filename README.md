## My Projects
### [The "Adventure" Playlist](https://www.github.com/jonathan-yeung/adventure_playlist)
I created a recommender system to find "relevant but novel" music tracks for listeners, and added a slide bar for them to customize the playlist for themselves.
Used techniques:
- content-based recommendation
- clustering: K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Agglomerative, GMM
- NLP: Count-vectorization

- Trend Following

Used techniques:
- visualizations using Plotly

- backtesting using Object-Oriented Programming
